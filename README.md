# S0PCM Reader for Home Assistant

[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]
![Reported Installations][installations-shield-stable]

An easy-to-use Home Assistant Add-on that reads pulse counters from an **S0PCM-2** or **S0PCM-5** device and sends the data to Home Assistant via MQTT.

This add-on is based on the [docker-s0pcm-reader](https://github.com/ualex73/docker-s0pcm-reader) by @ualex73.

## ✨ Features

- **MQTT Auto-Discovery**: Automatically creates sensors in Home Assistant for all enabled inputs.
- **Native Configuration**: Rename meters and correct totals directly from the **Device** page in Home Assistant UI—no YAML or manual MQTT actions required.
- **Dual-Layer State Recovery**: Robust restoration of meter data from both MQTT (primary) and the Home Assistant API (secondary fallback), ensuring no data loss even in a total wipeout.
- **TLS Support**: Secure your MQTT connection with TLS, featuring automatic fallback to plain MQTT if TLS fails.
- **Watchdog / Auto-restart**: Built on S6-overlay for robust process supervision and automatic recovery.
- **Real-time Error Reporting**: Dedicated MQTT topic and diagnostic sensor for instant feedback on serial or configuration issues.
- **Diagnostic Metadata**: New `info` topic and sensor providing versioning, hardware firmware, and uptime details.
- **Flexible MQTT**: Supports external brokers, authentication, and custom base topics.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- An **S0PCM reader** (S0PCM-2 or S0PCM-5) connected via USB.
- An **MQTT Broker** (e.g., the official Mosquitto broker add-on).

2. **Configure**: Create a `config/options.json` file inside the cloned directory (refer to `DOCS.md` for available configuration keys).
3. **Launch**: Use the following `docker-compose.yml` snippet:

```yaml
services:
  s0pcm-reader:
    build: 
      context: .
      args:
        - BUILD_FROM=python:3.14-alpine
    container_name: s0pcm-reader
    restart: unless-stopped
    devices:
      - /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 # Adjust to your port
