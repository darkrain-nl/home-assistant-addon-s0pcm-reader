# home-assistant-addon-s0pcm-reader

Please be aware this Add-on is work in progress and may not yet do what you expect from it.

If you understand this and want to help test it, great! If you don't want any hassle then please wait till it is a bit more user friendly.

The configuration.json and measurement.yaml files will be store in /share/s0pcm on your Home Assistant OS.
You can edit measurement.yaml to enter the current meter readings, they will then be used in the add-on after a restart.
